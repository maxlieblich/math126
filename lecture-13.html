<h2 id="how-to-describe-mt.-rainier-1">How to describe Mt. Rainier?</h2>
<ul>
<li>With poetry.</li>
<li>By height above the “ground”.</li>
<li>By depth below a giant tarp hovering at constant altitude above the mountain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assume-a-spherical-cow.">“Assume a spherical cow….”</h2>
<p>Let’s approximate and say that the mountain is shaped roughly like a paraboloid. We can peek under the mountain a bit to see the shadow it casts:</p>
<h2 id="describe-our-toy-mountain-using-numbers">Describe our toy mountain using numbers</h2>
<p>For each point in the shadow, record the height of the mountain over that point.</p>
<p>For our toy model, this function is <span class="math">\(f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\)</span></p>
<p>The general philosophy of functions still works.</p>
<ul>
<li>A function takes an input and returns an output.</li>
<li>There need not be a formula. The function could be defined on weird inputs.</li>
<li>For example: my desire for coffee (rated as “small”,“medium”, “large”) is a function of my fatigue (“mild”, “moderate”, “extreme”) and my rough Husky card balance (“empty”, “some”, “lots”). Thus, d(mild,lots)=small and d(extreme,some)=large, but perhaps d(extreme,none)=moderate. Etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-toy-picture-is-a-graph">Our toy picture is a graph</h2>
<p>The shape you have recorded is the graph of a function of two variables!</p>
<p>In this toy model, the function is <span class="math">\(f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\)</span>, so the graph is described by <span class="math">\(z=9-x^2-y^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Take a whack at graphing these:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x,y)=\sin(x)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x,y)=\sin(x)\cos(y)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x,y)=\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="match-the-graph-with-the-function">Match the graph with the function</h2>
<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\sin(x)\cos(y)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}\)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>*My college roommate studied Akkadian and found this written in Akkadian on a Pepsi can in 1999</p>
<p>Functions of two (or more!) variables have domains just like functions of one variable.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the domain is a natural consequence of the shape of the function.</p>
<p>Usually, the domain is specified in advance.</p>
<p>What are the natural domains of the following functions?</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x,y)=\sin(x)+\cos(|y|+\cos(x^{2012}))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x,y)=\ln(x+y)\)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>»Which of these contour maps corresponds to a circular cone?</p>
<p>»What is the function <span class="math">\(f(x,y)\)</span> whose graph in the region <span class="math">\(0\leq z\leq 9\)</span> is a circular cone with base radius <span class="math">\(3\)</span> and vertex at <span class="math">\((0,0,9)\)</span>?</p>

<p>Here’s a <a href="http://www.nationalatlas.gov/100topos/Mt_Rainier.html">link</a> to a map of Mt. Rainier from 1924 in the US national atlas.</p>
<p>What does it mean when the level curves are bunched together?</p>
<h2 id="what-about-more-variables">What about more variables?</h2>
<p>We can plot level surfaces for functions of three variables (but it’s rather hard to visualize). Here’s an example with <span class="math">\(f(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+2z^2\)</span>.</p>
