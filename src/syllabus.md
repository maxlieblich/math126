# Math 126 Syllabus

*This syllabus is subject to minor revision throughout the quarter; changes will be announced on the [course webpage](http://maxlieblich.github.io/math126), in class, or on Piazza (link provided when you signed up)*.

**Professor:** [Max Lieblich](http://www.math.washington.edu/~lieblich/)  
**Office:** Padelford C-529  
**Office hours:** See Piazza for current times.

**Course Materials:** The primary repository of information for the course will be the [course site](http://maxlieblich.github.io/math126) and Piazza. The discussion forum and logistical information (among other things) will be on Piazza.

**Text:** Multivariable Calculus by James Stewart.

**Course Content:** Vectors and vector functions, polar coordinates, calculus on vector functions, dot products and cross products, lines and planes, curvature, multi-variable functions, partial derivatives, optimization, tangent planes, double integrals, Taylor polynomials and Taylor series. You're going to love it!

**Course Organization:** Each week is outlined on the course website. There will be three lectures per week given by your instructor. In addition, you will meet on the discussion forum and in occasional online office hours to work on problems, discuss the homework, and get answers to your questions about the material.

You are responsible for the sections of the book indicated in the course outline, even if we do not get to discuss them in detail in lecture. *Important note: we will not be able to “cover” all of the material in lecture. This means that you get to have fun thinking about it on your own*! It is recommended that you try to read the material before it is discussed in class. If there is anything that you do not understand or would like to have explained in more detail, do not hesitate to ask. Remember that mathematics is learned mostly by working on problems. We will do our best to help you, but it is your participation that will make all the difference.

**Work/exams/fun:** All homework will be done through [webassign](https://www.webassign.net/washington/login.html). Dr. Taggart has also written a description of [how to use it](http://www.math.washington.edu/~taggart/m126/howtowebassign.html).

-   The biweekly **homework assignments** will be due on Tuesdays and Thursdays, through webassign. ***Late homework will not be accepted.***
-   You will keep a **calculus journal** online. You
    will periodically write an entry describing how the material you are learning
    about appears in your lives. For example, you might make a toy model
    of the terrain between your room/apartment and class and try to
    estimate the total number of meters you actually walk (accounting
    for elevation changes) to get here. Etc. Due dates will be described in Piazza.
-   Occasional **quizzes** will be very short multiple choice quizzes
    that are meant to help you keep up with the course. They will happen
    sporadically, if at all.
-   The two **midterm tests** will take place on the dates specified in the 
-   "schedule" section of the Resources tab on Piazza. No
    make-up exams will be given. Rules for the exams will be specified on Piazza.
-   The **final exam** will contain questions from all the topics
    covered in the course, and will be held on a date specified in
    Piazza. There will be a make-up final on a day
    during finals period. You may bring one formula
    sheet to the exam; this is a single 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper,
    with writing permitted on both sides.

**Grading:** Your final grade for Math 126 will be computed from your exam scores, your homework, your journal entries, and your quizzes (if applicable). Roughly speaking, each exam will have equal weight, but we reserve the right to adjust the weights, with no exam weight ever exceeding 0.5. The exams will be graded together on a curve with median targeted at roughly 2.9. Other course components -- homework, journals, Piazza participation -- will then be treated as indicator variables that make adjustments to the exam-grade. Earning more than roughly 85% of homework points will earn a positive 0.1 adjustment, while earning less than 60% of homework points will result in -0.1 adjustment; anything in between will have no effect. Outstanding journal entries will also result in a positive adjustment of 0.1. Poor work will yield a negative adjustment. Etc. We will periodically update you with comprehensive reports on class exam performance.

**Calculators:** Only simple scientific calculators will be allowed on the midterms and the final exam. Any calculator that can replace your brain (or mine!) is not permitted.

**Math Study Center:** You are encouraged to visit the Math Study Center for help with the course. It is located in Communications B-014. The hours are

-   M - Th: 9:30 AM to 9:30 PM
-   Fri: 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM
-   Sun: 2 PM to 6 PM
