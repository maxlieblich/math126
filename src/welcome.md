# Welcome

We are excited to have you with us for online Math 126! This site is in
constant development as we move our whole operation to a flexible open-source framework. Look for improvements every day. Visit our
[GitHub site](https://github.com/maxlieblich/math126), feel free to open new
issues, send us pull requests, etc. Videos drawn from the old (deprecated) site are now embedded at the bottom of each lecture as links. Don't forget to scroll down if you want to hear the monologues! (We may do something more fancy in the future.) You will find the material on this site to be somewhere between spare lecture notes and the longer explanations in your book. Use all of the resources! (We will add more here as we accumulate them.)
