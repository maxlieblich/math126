Vector valued functions: theory
===============================

Medium-term question
--------------------

A fun-loving electron is traveling in a spiral path around the surface
of a torus.

-   The radius of the torus (i.e., the radius of the circle at the
    center of the tube) is $2$ and the diameter of the circular
    cross-section is $1$.
-   The electron starts at position $(1,0,0)$, travels at a constant
    angular velocity around the vertical axis of $1$ radian per
    second, and its path winds up and around the torus $4$ times
    before it returns to its starting position.

What is the position and velocity of the electron at time $t$?

Fun-loving electron in action
-----------------------------

A similar but simpler question
------------------------------

A socially awkward electron is traveling in a spiral path around the
surface of a cylinder.

-   The cylinder has radius $1$ and height $4$
-   The electron starts at position $(1,0,0)$, travels
    counterclockwise at a rotational speed of $1$ radian per second.
-   Its path winds around the cylinder exactly $4$ times when it
    reaches the top.

What is the electron's position at time $t$?

Awkward electron (loop)

Teach the piglet of calculus
----------------------------

### How can we break down the motion into pieces the piglet of calculus can digest?

-   How would you explain the motion to the piglet?
-   The piglet needs a precise description in order to predict future
    positions.
-   If the piglet fails, it's bacon time. Don't let that happen.
-   Any ideas?

Parametric description
----------------------

We can trace the coordinates of the electron as it moves, giving
functions $$\begin{align\*} x&=x(t)\\ y&=y(t)\\ z&=z(t)
\end{align\*} $$

Equivalent formulation: view $\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)\rangle$ as a
vector-valued function.

How do we figure out these functions?
