Optimization
============

Horizontality is not just for napping
-------------------------------------

For the graph to reach a minimum or maximum (i.e., for small changes to
be positive or negative), the tangent plane must be horizontal.

This smacks of local max and min. Remember that?

Local max and min
-----------------

You mastered this for functions $f(x)$ of one variable:

-   Look for points where $f'(x)$ is undefined.
-   Solve $f'(x)=0$.
-   The options: either $x$ is a local maximum, a local minimum, or an
    inflection point.
-   Local max/min are sometimes (but not always) distinguished by the
    sign of $f''(x)$: pos for min, neg for max
-   Inflection points occur when $f''(x)$ changes sign.

How does this work for functions of multiple variables?

Locate potential local max/min
------------------------------

Key observation: if $f(x,y)$ has a local max/min at $(a,b)$ then
$f_x(a,b)=0$ and $f_y(a,b)=0$, or at least one of the partial
derivatives is undefined.

Definition: a point $(a,b)$ is a critical point if **EITHER**

1.  $f_x(a,b)=0$ and $f_y(a,b)=0$, **OR**
2.  one of these partial derivatives is undefined at $(a,b)$.

Critical point lovefest
-----------------------

Find all critical points for the following functions.

-   $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$
-   $f(x,y)=x^2-y^2$
-   $f(x,y)=\sin(x)\cos(y)$
-   $f(x,y)=x^y$
-   $f(x,y)=x^3+y^3+x+y$

Can you tell which of these critical points are local maxima or minima?
