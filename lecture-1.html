<h1 id="introduction-calculus-in-multiple-dimensions">Introduction: Calculus in Multiple Dimensions</h1>
<p><strong>What is this course about?</strong></p>
<p>You’ve seen derivatives, integrals, and differential equations in one variable only. We’ve really only equipped you to understand “life on a string”. How can we understand a situation closer to reality, one involving three (or more!) dimensions?</p>
<p>This course will introduce you to calculus in multiple dimensions. Unlike previous courses, it will rely more heavily on visualization skills and physical understanding/intuition than symbol pushing. Here’s a rough <strong>outline of topics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baby steps in three dimensions: 3D coordinates, vectors, lines and planes, dot and cross products, quadric surfaces (~Weeks 1-3)</li>
<li>Beginning Calculus in 3D: properties of parametric curves, functions of two variables, tangent lines and curves, optimization, differentials (~Weeks 4-6); multiple integrals and polar coordinates (~Weeks 7-8)</li>
<li>Taylor Series: polynomial approximation, error bounds, series (~Weeks 9-11).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modeling-3d-space-cartesian-coordinates">1. Modeling 3D space: Cartesian coordinates</h2>
<p>What is 3D space? Here’s a picture: <br><br><br></br></br></br></p>
<p>No, really, that’s a picture. Do you think it’s missing something?</p>
<p>Rene Descartes (famous for thinking and, therefore, being) thought so. He thought of something brilliant, something that shook the world. No, not that thing about the pineal gland and the soul, the other one: coordinates.</p>
<p>The 3D space of human experience is the set of ordered triples of numbers:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathbf{R^3}=\{(x,y,z) \mid x,y,z\in\mathbf{R}\}\]</span> (Read as, “The set of triples x, y, z such that x, y, and z are all real numbers.”) Here’s a picture you probably recognize:</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/cartesian.png" />
</figure>
<h2 id="objects-in-space-points-and-distance">2. Objects in space: points and distance!</h2>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> In the picture, how far is <span class="math">\((x, y, z)\)</span> (“the point x, y, z”) from the origin, <span class="math">\((0, 0, 0)\)</span>? Remember the Pythagorean Theorem as you try it.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Explain why your answer to the previous exercise says that the distance between two points <span class="math">\((a,b,c)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((a&#39;,b&#39;,c&#39;)\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sqrt{(a-a&#39;)^2+(b-b&#39;)^2+(c-c&#39;)^2}.\]</span></p>
<p>If you need help, the book has a good explanation of this, but see if you can figure it out before you read it! If you’ve already read it, try before reading it again. (You read each section of the book several times, right?)</p>
<p>We can now describe shapes, at least implicitly!</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the set of points at distance 1 from <span class="math">\((0,0,0)\)</span>?</li>
<li>What shape is the set of points <span class="math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(x+y=z\)</span>?</li>
<li>…such that <span class="math">\(x^2+y^2=z^2\)</span>?</li>
<li>…such that <span class="math">\(x^2+y^2=z\)</span>? (How does it differ from the previous one?)</li>
<li>…such that <span class="math">\(y=x^2\)</span>?</li>
<li>…such that <span class="math">\(z=4\)</span>?</li>
</ul>
<p>(Don’t worry if you can’t do all of these now. Start worrying if you still can’t do them after we’ve gone over quadric surfaces.)</p>

<p>Imagine these objects are planets. People living on the first would probably weigh things like humans—stick it on a scale, read a number, utterly ignore any minor changes in gravity’s strength. People on the second would have to say where on the planet they measured things (“45 pounds at latitude 50”). (“Newtons” are more appropriate than “kilograms” in this story’s metric version.)</p>
<p>This is vague and qualitative, while Math is rigorous and quantitative, so let’s add some rigor. We might try computing the average strength of gravity on the surface of the second world as well as its maximum and minimum strength. Well, averages are just integrals, so let’s integrate gravity… over… a surface?</p>
<p>Integrating over a surface is a great idea, but it’s a bit too much for us right now, and, sadly, we won’t (really) do surface integrals this quarter; take more multivariable calculus for that experience. This quarter, we’ll focus on properties of objects in space like curvature (what is this?), surface area, volume, ….</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> What other mathematical properties might distinguish objects (lines, curves, surfaces, etc.)? Can you make any of them rigorous enough to compute for some toy examples?</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-trefoil-riders">4. What about the trefoil riders?</h2>
<p>Finding out whether or not the trefoil riders will black out will have to wait until we’ve developed enough tools to define and compute the acceleration of a point in space.</p>
In the mean time, here’s some math love to end on:
