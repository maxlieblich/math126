<h1 id="vector-valued-functions">Vector valued functions</h1>
<p>We are now going to start studying the calculus of one-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space. In other words, the properties of curves. What forces does a bean sliding along a track experience? How do we mathematically express the notion of curvature? How do we calculate the velocity of a moving particle, or the total distance it travels during a motion? As you will see, the key is to use vectors to leverage the familiar calculus of one variable.</p>
<h3 id="medium-term-question">Medium-term question</h3>
<p>Here’s a question that we will return to a few times. It deals with a path on a surface. This is how it goes:</p>
<p>A fun-loving electron is traveling in a spiral path around the surface of a torus.</p>
<ul>
<li>The radius of the torus (i.e., the radius of the circle at the center of the tube) is <span class="math">\(2\)</span> and the diameter of the circular cross-section is <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>The electron starts at position <span class="math">\((1,0,0)\)</span>, travels at a constant angular velocity around the vertical axis of <span class="math">\(1\)</span> radian per second, and its path winds up and around the torus <span class="math">\(4\)</span> times before it returns to its starting position.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the position and velocity of the electron at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>?</p>
<h4 id="fun-loving-electron-in-action">Fun-loving electron in action</h4>
<p>Here’s a display of the electron skittering around on the torus. The electron will move when you click on the scene; it might freeze when you stop interacting, to save resources.</p>

<p>As usual, it is often instructive to start with a <em>simpler</em> question that has the same flavor. Here’s one:</p>
<p>A socially awkward electron is traveling in a spiral path around the surface of a cylinder.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cylinder has radius <span class="math">\(1\)</span> and height <span class="math">\(4\)</span></li>
<li>The electron starts at position <span class="math">\((1,0,0)\)</span>, travels counterclockwise at a rotational speed of <span class="math">\(1\)</span> radian per second.</li>
<li>Its path winds around the cylinder exactly <span class="math">\(4\)</span> times when it reaches the top.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the electron’s position at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>?</p>

<h3 id="teach-the-piglet-of-calculus">Teach the piglet of calculus</h3>
<p>In medicine, they have a saying: “see one, do one, teach one”. If you are learning to do a complex procedure at the critical boundary of life and death, you <em>learn it better when you have to explain it to someone</em>. Effortful recall, thinking hard, dredging up explanations – these lead to learning. Going through the motions just to get to the next thing…not so much.</p>
<p>So here’s an exercise: can you explain what is happening here to the piglet of calculus? (The piglet of calculus is our mascot. You may not have seen a picture yet, but you will.) More precisely, think about the following.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-we-break-down-the-motion-into-pieces-the-piglet-of-calculus-can-digest">How can we break down the motion into pieces the piglet of calculus can digest?</h4>
<ul>
<li>How would you explain the motion to the piglet?</li>
<li>The piglet needs a precise description in order to predict future positions. The piglet needs the <em>coordinates</em>.</li>
<li>If the piglet fails, it’s bacon time. Don’t let that happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before moving on, <em>take a moment to think about this</em>. It will be better if you have struggled with this for a bit before you see one way to approach it.</p>
<h3 id="parametric-description">Parametric description</h3>
<p>We can trace the coordinates of the electron as it moves, giving functions <span class="math">\[\begin{align} x&amp;=x(t)\\ y&amp;=y(t)\\ z&amp;=z(t)
\end{align} \]</span></p>
<p>Equivalent formulation: view <span class="math">\(\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)\rangle\)</span> as a vector-valued function.</p>
<p>How do we figure out these functions?</p>
<h3 id="one-method-projection">One method: projection</h3>
<p>One common method is to project the path on lower-dimensional spaces in order to build it up from simpler parts. This is a fancy say to saying: ignore some coordinates and try to describe the simpler motion. We already saw that ignoring coordinates is one way of <em>casting a shadow</em>.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of this method in practice.</p>
<h4 id="image-in-the-xy-plane">Image in the <span class="math">\(xy\)</span>-plane</h4>
<p>As we’ve seen, ignoring the <span class="math">\(z\)</span> coordinate of the electron on the cylinder is the same as projecting the path into the <span class="math">\(xy\)</span>-plane. (In other words, look down at the motion from directly above.) For the electron spiraling up the cylinder, projecting to the <span class="math">\(xy\)</span>-plane eliminates the “up” from the description. That is, the projection of the electron into the plane just moves in a circle.</p>
<ul>
<li>The radius is <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>It moves at <span class="math">\(1\)</span> radian per second.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> coordinates as functions of <span class="math">\(t\)</span>? The usual trigonometric formulas give</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(x(t),y(t))=(\cos(t),\sin(t)).\]</span></p>
<p>This already gives us two of the three coordinates! We’re almost done!</p>
<h4 id="what-about-z">What about <span class="math">\(z\)</span>?</h4>
<p>The key to finding the last coordinate <span class="math">\(z(t)\)</span> is the timing of the revolutions. One revolution takes <span class="math">\(2\pi\)</span> seconds. It should take four revolutions to get to the top (<span class="math">\(z=4\)</span>), so <span class="math">\(8\pi\)</span> seconds. Putting these together: <span class="math">\(z(t)=4t/8\pi\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h4>
<p>Reassembling the simpler parts, we end up with this description of our path up the cylinder.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (\cos(t),\sin(t), t/2\pi).\]</span></p>
<p>Beautiful!</p>
<p>Now what about the torus?  </p>
<h3 id="a-parametric-description-of-the-torus">A parametric description of the torus</h3>
<p>One way to attack the torus us to unzip it and roll it out onto a square. The fancier way to say this is: we can leverage a two-dimensional parametric description of the surface of the torus. <em>Note</em>: you may never have seen anything like this before. Enjoy it!</p>
<p>Given two numbers <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u\)</span> between <span class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(2\pi\)</span>, we get a point on a torus of radius <span class="math">\(2\)</span> and tube radius <span class="math">\(1\)</span> like this:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align} x(t,u)&amp;=\cos(t)(2-\cos(u))\\
y(t,u)&amp;=\sin(t)(2-\cos(u))\\ z(t,u)&amp;=\sin(u) \end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>If you fix <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-path is a circle around the torus. If you fix <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, the <span class="math">\(u\)</span>-path is a circle around the “tube”.</p>
<p>Use this to make a spiral path around the torus that starts at <span class="math">\((1,0,0)\)</span> and winds around the tube <span class="math">\(4\)</span> times before it returns to its starting point.</p>
<p>Hint: substitute for <span class="math">\(u\)</span> as a function of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> to make the two act in concert!</p>
<p>This is not trivial when you are just learning about these things. That is why it is worth doing.</p>
<h3 id="question">Question</h3>
<p>Let’s end with a question to think about as you reflect on this material. Two tiny cars travel on paths</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align} (x,y,z)&amp;=(\cos(t),\sin(t),0)\\
(x&#39;,y&#39;,z&#39;)&amp;=(0,\cos(t),\sin(t)) \end{align} \]</span></p>
<p>Will they collide? What does it mean to collide? It means that the cars will be in the same place at the same time.</p>
<p>To make things more interesting, now suppose the second car travels at a different speed so that <span class="math">\((x&#39;,y&#39;,z&#39;)=(0,\cos(\alpha t),\sin(\alpha t))\)</span>. For which constants <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> will the tiny cars collide?</p>
